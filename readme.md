This plugin is no longer maintained as was built to fix an issue in a web app I built for my old company. For a better solution look at lolmaus's plugin...

jQuery Special Event - jquery.event.dragout
==============================

Special event created to handle true dragleave functionality.

HTML5 dragleave event works more like mouseout. This plugin was created to replicate the mouseleave style functionality whilst dragging.

Usage Example
--------------

	$('#myelement').on('dragout',function(event){ 

		// YOUR CODE

	});
